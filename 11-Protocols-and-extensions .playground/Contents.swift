// ************* Protocols and extensions
/*
 Today you’re going to learn some truly Swifty functionality: protocols and protocol-oriented programming (POP).

 POP does away with large, complex inheritance hierarchies, and replaces them with much smaller, simpler protocols that can be combined together. This really is the fulfillment of something Tony Hoare said many years ago: “inside every large program, there is a small program trying to get out.”

 Today you have six one-minute videos to watch, and you’ll meet protocols, extensions, and the combination of those two: protocol extensions. Once you’ve watched each video and any optional extra reading you wanted, there’s a short test to help make sure you’ve understood what was taught.
*/

//********* Protocols

/*
 Protocols are a way of describing what properties and methods something must have. You then tell Swift which types use that protocol – a process known as adopting or conforming to a protocol.

 For example, we can write a function that accepts something with an id property, but we don’t care precisely what type of data is used. We’ll start by creating an Identifiable protocol, which will require all conforming types to have an id string that can be read (“get”) or written (“set”):
*/
protocol Identifiable {
    var id: String {get set}
}

/*
 We can’t create instances of that protocol - it’s a description of what we want, rather than something we can create and use directly. But we can create a struct that conforms to it:
*/

struct User: Identifiable {
    var id: String
}

// Finally, we’ll write a displayID() function that accepts any Identifiable object:

func displayID(thing: Identifiable) {
    print("My ID is \(thing.id)")
}

// Why does Swift need protocols?

/*
 Protocols let us define how structs, classes, and enums ought to work: what methods they should have, and what properties they should have. Swift will enforce these rules for us, so that when we say a type conforms to a protocol Swift will make sure it has all the methods and properties required by that protocol.

 In practice, what protocols allow us to do is treat our data in more general terms. So, rather than saying “this buy() method must accept a Book object,” we can say “this method can accept anything that conforms to the Purchaseable protocol. That might be a book, but it might also be a movie, a car, some coffee, and so on – it makes our simple method more flexible, while ensuring that Swift enforces the rules for us.

 In code terms, our simple buy() method that works only with books would look like this:
*/

/*struct Book {
    var name: String
}

func buy(_ book: Book){
    print("I`m buying \(book.name)")
}
*/

/*
 To create a more flexible, protocol-based approach we would first create a protocol that declares the basic functionality we need. This might be many methods and properties, but here we’re just going to say that we need a name string:
*/

protocol Purchaseable {
    var name: String {get set}
}

/*
 Now we can go ahead and define as many structs as we need, with each one conforming to that protocol by having a name string:
*/

struct Book: Purchaseable {
    var name: String
    var author: String
}

struct Movie: Purchaseable {
    var name: String
    var actors: [String]
}

struct Car: Purchaseable {
    var name: String
    var manufacturer: String
}

struct Coffee: Purchaseable {
    var name: String
    var strength: Int
}

/*
 You’ll notice each one of those types has a different property that wasn’t declared in the protocol, and that’s okay – protocols determine the minimum required functionality, but we can always add more.

 Finally, we can rewrite the buy() function so that it accepts any kind of Purchaseable item:
*/

func buy(_ item: Purchaseable) {
    print("I'm buying \(item.name)")
}

/*
 Inside that method we can use the name property of our item safely, because Swift will guarantee that each Purchaseable item has a name property. It doesn’t guarantee that any of the other properties we defined will exist, only the ones that are specifically declared in the protocol.

 So, protocols let us create blueprints of how our types share functionality, then use those blueprints in our functions to let them work on a wider variety of data.
*/


// ****************** Protocol inheritance
print("************** Protocol inheritance *************")

/*
 One protocol can inherit from another in a process known as protocol inheritance. Unlike with classes, you can inherit from multiple protocols at the same time before you add your own customizations on top.

 We’re going to define three protocols: Payable requires conforming types to implement a calculateWages() method, NeedsTraining requires conforming types to implement a study() method, and HasVacation requires conforming types to implement a takeVacation() method:
*/

protocol Payable {
    func calculateWages() -> Int
}

protocol NeedsTraining {
    func study()
}

protocol HasVacation {
    func takeVacation(days: Int)
}

/*
 We can now create a single Employee protocol that brings them together in one protocol. We don’t need to add anything on top, so we’ll just write open and close braces:
*/

protocol Employee: Payable, NeedsTraining, HasVacation {}

// Now we can make new types conform to that single protocol rather than each of the three individual ones.


// When should we use protocol inheritance?

/*
 Swift lets us build new protocol based on existing protocols, much like the way it lets us build new classes based on existing classes.

 One common reason for using protocol inheritance is to combine functionality for common work. For example:

 - All products have a price and a weight
 - All computers have a CPU, plus how much memory they have and how much storage
 - All laptops have a screen size
 You could absolutely define a Computer protocol like this:
*/

protocol Computer {
    var price: Double { get set}
    var weight: Int {get set}
    var cpu: String {get set}
    var memory: Int {get set}
    var storage: Int { get set }
}

// Then define a Laptop protocol like this:

protocol Laptop {
    var price: Double {get set}
    var weight: Int { get set }
    var cpu: String { get set }
    var memory: Int {get set }
    var storage: Int {get set }
    var screenSize: Int {get set }
}

/*
 But do you see how much duplication we already have? Now imagine working with phones and tablets – more protocols, and more duplication.

 It’s much simpler and more flexible if we break our protocols up into smaller parts, then reassemble them like Lego bricks.

 So, we could start by defining what a product looks like:
*/

protocol Product {
    var price: Double {get set}
    var weight: Int {get set}
}

// We could then define what a computer looks like, by basing it on a Product then adding some extras:

protocol ComputerProtocol: Product {
    var cpu: String { get set }
    var memory: Int {get set}
    var storage: Int {get set}
}

// Now we can define what a Laptop looks like, by basing it on a Computer (and therefore also a Product), and adding another property:

protocol LaptopProtocol: ComputerProtocol {
    var screenSize: Int {get set}
}

/*
 As you can see, using protocol inheritance in this way lets us share definitions and reduce duplication, which is a great way to build up functionality piece by piece.

 The second common reason for using protocol inheritance is to add extra restrictions when they make sense. For example, Swift has a protocol called Equatable, which means “this thing can be checked for equality against other instances of the same type,” and it’s what makes 5 == 6 return false. Swift also has a protocol called Comparable, which means “this type can be checked to see whether it is less than or greater than another instance of the same type,” and it’s what makes "Hello" < "World" return true.

 Think about it: if we can know whether an object is less than or greater than some other object, then we must also be able to know when it is the same as the other object. That is, if number X is not less than number Y, and is also not greater than number Y, then X and Y must be equal.

 Rather than copy all the functionality of Equatable into Comparable, Swift just uses protocol inheritance so that Comparable inherits from Equatable.
*/


// *********** Extensions

print("************** Extensions **************")

/*
 Extensions allow you to add methods to existing types, to make them do things they weren’t originally designed to do.

 For example, we could add an extension to the Int type so that it has a squared() method that returns the current number multiplied by itself:
*/

extension Int {
    func squared() -> Int{
        return self * self
    }
}

// To try that out, just create an integer and you’ll see it now has a squared() method:

let number = 8
number.squared()
let number2 = 5
number2.squared()

/*
 Swift doesn’t let you add stored properties in extensions, so you must use computed properties instead. For example, we could add a new isEven computed property to integers that returns true if it holds an even number:
*/

extension Int {
    var isEven: Bool {
        return self % 2 == 0
    }
}

let numberEven = 16
numberEven.isEven

let oddNumber = 7
oddNumber.isEven


// When should you use extensions in Swift?

/*
 Extensions let us add functionality to classes, structs, and more, which is helpful for modifying types we don’t own – types that were written by Apple or someone else, for example. Methods added using extensions are indistinguishable from methods that were originally part of the type, but there is a difference for properties: extensions may not add new stored properties, only computed properties.

 Extensions are also useful for organizing our own code, and although there are several ways of doing this I want to focus on two here: conformance grouping and purpose grouping.

 Conformance grouping means adding a protocol conformance to a type as an extension, adding all the required methods inside that extension. This makes it easier to understand how much code a developer needs to keep in their head while reading an extension – if the current extension adds support for Printable, they won’t find printing methods mixed in with methods from other, unrelated protocols.

 On the other hand, purpose grouping means creating extensions to do specific tasks, which makes it easier to work with large types. For example, you might have an extension specifically to handle loading and saving of that type.

 It’s worth adding here that many folks realize they have a large class and try to make it smaller by splitting it into extensions. To be quite clear: the type is exactly the same size it was before, it’s just neatly split up. This does mean it’s likely to be a little easier to understand, but it doesn’t mean the class is any smaller.
*/


// ********* Protocol extensions

print("************ Protocol extensions ************")

/*
 Protocols let you describe what methods something should have, but don’t provide the code inside. Extensions let you provide the code inside your methods, but only affect one data type – you can’t add the method to lots of types at the same time.

 Protocol extensions solve both those problems: they are like regular extensions, except rather than extending a specific type like Int you extend a whole protocol so that all conforming types get your changes.

 For example, here is an array and a set containing some names:
*/

let pythons = ["Eric", "Graham", "John", "Michael", "Terry", "Terry"]
let beatles = Set(["John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo"])

/*
 Swift’s arrays and sets both conform to a protocol called Collection, so we can write an extension to that protocol to add a summarize() method to print the collection neatly
*/

extension Collection {
    func summarize() {
        print("there are \(count) of us:")
        
        for name in self {
            print(name)
        }
    }
}

// Both Array and Set will now have that method, so we can try it out:

pythons.summarize()
beatles.summarize()


// When are protocol extensions useful in Swift?

/*
 Protocol extensions are used everywhere in Swift, which is why you’ll often see it described as a “protocol-oriented programming language.” We use them to add functionality directly to protocols, which means we don’t need to copy that functionality across many structs and classes.

 For example, Swift’s arrays have an allSatisfy() method that returns true if all the items in the array pass a test. So, we could create an array of numbers and check that they are all even:
*/


let numberList = [4, 8, 15, 16]
let allEven = numberList.allSatisfy{ $0.isMultiple(of: 2)}

// That’s really useful, but wouldn’t it be more useful if it also worked on sets? Sure it would, and that’s why it does:

let numberList2 = Set([4, 8, 15, 16])
let allEven2 = numberList2.allSatisfy{ $0.isMultiple(of: 2)}

/*
 The underlying principle is identical: pass each item in the array or set through a test you provide, and if that returns true for all items then the result of the method is true.

 How about dictionaries – can they use this too? Sure they can, and it works identically: each key/value pair gets passed into the closure, and you need to return either true or false. It looks like this:
*/

let numberList3 = ["four": 4, "eight": 8, "fifteen": 15, "sixteen": 16]
let allEven3 = numberList3.allSatisfy{ $0.value.isMultiple(of: 2)}

/*
 Of course, the Swift developers don’t want to write this same code again and again, so they used a protocol extension: they wrote a single allSatisfy() method that works on a protocol called Sequence, which all arrays, sets, and dictionaries conform to. This meant the allSatisfy() method immediately became available on all those types, sharing exactly the same code.
*/


protocol Fencer {
    func fenceFoil()
}
extension Fencer {
    func fenceFoil() {
        print("En garde!")
    }
}


// ************ Protocol-oriented programming

/*
 Protocol extensions can provide default implementations for our own protocol methods. This makes it easy for types to conform to a protocol, and allows a technique called “protocol-oriented programming” – crafting your code around protocols and protocol extensions.

 First, here’s a protocol called Identifiable that requires any conforming type to have an id property and an identify() method:
 */

protocol Identifiable2 {
    var id: String { get set }
    func identify()
}

/*
 We could make every conforming type write their own identify() method, but protocol extensions allow us to provide a default:
*/

extension Identifiable2 {
    func identify() {
        print("My ID is \(id).")
    }
}

// Now when we create a type that conforms to Identifiable it gets identify() automatically:

struct Usuario: Identifiable2 {
    var id: String
}

let felipe = Usuario(id: "Felipe")
felipe.identify()

// How is protocol-oriented programming different from object-oriented programming?

/*
 Many Swift developers describe the language as being protocol-oriented, but what does that really mean? In particular, how is it different from the older object-oriented paradigm?

 Getting down to the raw facts, there is no practical difference between the two: both can place functionality into objects, use access control to limit where that functionality can be called, make one class inherit from another, and more.

 Some might say that the only real difference between the two is that in protocol-oriented programming (POP) we prefer to build functionality by composing protocols (“this new struct conforms to protocols X, Y, and Z”), whereas in object-oriented programming (OOP) we prefer to build functionality through class inheritance. However, even that is dubious because OOP developers also usually prefer composing functionality to inheriting it – it’s just easier to maintain.

 In fact, the only important difference between the two is one of mindset: POP developers lean heavily on the protocol extension functionality of Swift to build types that get a lot of their behavior from protocols. This makes it easier to share functionality across many types, which in turn lets us build bigger, more powerful software without having to write so much code.

 For more information about protocol-oriented programming, you should watch Dave Abraham’s talk at WWDC that introduced the topic: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/
