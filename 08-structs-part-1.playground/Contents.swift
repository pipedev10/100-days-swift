// ************ Creating your own structs

/*
 Swift lets you design your own types in two ways, of which the most common are called structures, or just structs. Structs can be given their own variables and constants, and their own functions, then created and used however you want.

 Let’s start with a simple example: we’re going to create a Sport struct that stores its name as a string. Variables inside structs are called properties, so this is a struct with one property:
*/

struct Sport {
    var name: String
}

// That defines the type, so now we can create and use an instance of it:

var tennis = Sport(name: "Tennis")
print(tennis.name)

// We made both name and tennis variable, so we can change them just like regular variables:

tennis.name = "Lawn tennis"
print(tennis.name)

// Properties can have default values just like regular variables, and you can usually rely on Swift’s type inference.


// What’s the difference between a struct and a tuple?

/*
 Swift’s tuples let us store several different named values inside a single variable, and a struct does much the same – so what’s the difference, and when should you choose one over the other?

 When you’re just learning, the difference is simple: a tuple is effectively just a struct without a name, like an anonymous struct. This means you can define it as (name: String, age: Int, city: String) and it will do the same thing as the following struct:
*/

struct User {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    var city: String
}

/*
 However, tuples have a problem: while they are great for one-off use, particularly when you want to return several pieces of data from a single function, they can be annoying to use again and again.

 Think about it: if you have several functions that work with user information, would you rather write this:
*/

func authenticate(_ user: User){}
func showProfile(for user: User){}
func signOut(_ user: User){}

// or this
func authenticate(_ user: (name: String, age: Int, city: String)) { }
func showProfile(for user: (name: String, age: Int, city: String)) { }
func signOut(_ user: (name: String, age: Int, city: String)) { }

/*
 Think about how hard it would be to add a new property to your User struct (very easy indeed), compared to how hard it would be to add another value to your tuple everywhere it was used? (Very hard, and error-prone!)

 So, use tuples when you want to return two or more arbitrary pieces of values from a function, but prefer structs when you have some fixed data you want to send or receive multiple times.
*/


// ******************* Computed properties
// We just created a Sport struct like this:
struct SportTwo {
    var name: String
}

/*
 That has a name property that stores a String. These are called stored properties, because Swift has a different kind of property called a computed property – a property that runs code to figure out its value.

 We’re going to add another stored property to the Sport struct, then a computed property. Here’s how that looks:
*/

struct SportComputedProperties {
    var name: String
    var isOlympic: Bool
    
    var olympicStatus: String {
        if isOlympic {
            return "\(name) is an olympic sport"
        }else {
            return "\(name) is not an olympic sport"
        }
    }
}

/*
 As you can see, olympicStatus looks like a regular String, but it returns different values depending on the other properties.

 We can try it out by creating a new instance of Sport:
*/

let chessBoxing = SportComputedProperties(name: "ChessBoxing", isOlympic: false)
print(chessBoxing.olympicStatus)

// When should you use a computed property or a stored property?
/*
 Properties let us attach information to structs, and Swift gives us two variations: stored properties, where a value is stashed away in some memory to be used later, and computed properties, where a value is recomputed every time it’s called. Behind the scenes, a computed property is effectively just a function call that happens to belong to your struct.

 Deciding which to use depends partly on whether your property’s value depends on other data, and partly also on performance. The performance part is easy: if you regularly read the property when its value hasn’t changed, then using a stored property will be much faster than using a computed property. On the other hand, if your property is read very rarely and perhaps not at all, then using a computed property saves you from having to calculate its value and store it somewhere.

 When it comes to dependencies – whether your property’s value relies on the values of your other properties – then the tables are turned: this is a place where computed properties are useful, because you can be sure the value they return always takes into account the latest program state.

 Lazy properties help mitigate the performance issues of rarely read stored properties, and property observers mitigate the dependency problems of stored properties – we’ll be looking at them soon.
*/

struct Toy {
    var color: String
    var isForGirls: Bool {
        if color == "Pink" {
            return true
        } else {
            return true
        }
    }
}


// **************** Property observers

/*
 Property observers let you run code before or after any property changes. To demonstrate this, we’ll write a Progress struct that tracks a task and a completion percentage:
*/

struct Progress {
    var task: String
    var amount: Int {
        // What we want to happen is for Swift to print a message every time amount changes, and we can use a didSet property observer for that. This will run some code every time amount changes:
        didSet {
            print("\(task) is now \(amount)% complete")
        }
    }
}

// We can now create an instance of that struct and adjust its progress over time:

var progress = Progress(task: "Loading data", amount: 0)
progress.amount = 30
progress.amount = 80
progress.amount = 100

// You can also use willSet to take action before a property changes, but that is rarely used.

// When should you use property observers?
/*
 Swift’s property observers let us attach functionality to be run before or after a property is changed, using willSet and didSet respectively. Most of the time property observers aren’t required, just nice to have – we could just update a property normally then call a function ourselves in code. So why bother? When would you actually use property observers?

 The most important reason is convenience: using a property observer means your functionality will be executed whenever the property changes. Sure, you could use a function to do that, but would you remember? Always? In every place you change the property?

 This is where the function approach goes sour: it’s on you to remember to call that function whenever the property changes, and if you forget then you’ll have mysterious bugs in your code. On the other hand, if you attach your functionality directly to the property using didSet, it will always happen, and you’re transferring the work of ensuring that to Swift so your brain can focus on more interesting problems.

 There is one place where using a property observer is a bad idea, and that’s if you put slow work in there. If you had a User struct with an age integer, you would expect that changing age would take place virtually instantly – it’s just a number, after all. If you attach a didSet property observer that does all sorts of slow work, then suddenly changing a single integer could take way longer than you expected, and it could cause all sorts of problems for you.
*/

// When should you use willSet rather than didSet?
/*
 Both willSet and didSet let us attach observers to properties, meaning that Swift will run some code when they change so that we have a chance to respond to the change. The question is: do you want to know before the property changes, or after?

 The simple answer is this: most of the time you will be using didSet, because we want to take action after the change has happened so we can update our user interface, save changes, or whatever. That doesn’t mean willSet isn’t useful, it’s just that in practice it is significantly less popular than its counterpart.

 The most common time willSet is used is when you need to know the state of your program before a change is made. For example, SwiftUI uses willSet in some places to handle animations so that it can take a snapshot of the user interface before a change. When it has both the “before” and “after” snapshot, it can compare the two to see all the parts of the user interface that need to be updated.
 */


// **************** Methods

/*
 Structs can have functions inside them, and those functions can use the properties of the struct as they need to. Functions inside structs are called methods, but they still use the same func keyword.

 We can demonstrate this with a City struct. This will have a population property that stores how many people are in the city, plus a collectTaxes() method that returns the population count multiplied by 1000. Because the method belongs to City it can read the current city’s population property.

 Here’s the code:
*/

struct City {
    var population: Int
    
    func collectTaxes() -> Int {
        return population * 1000
    }
}

// That method belongs to the struct, so we call it on instances of the struct like this:

let santiago = City(population: 7_000_000)
santiago.collectTaxes()


// What’s the difference between a function and a method?

/*
 Swift’s functions let us name a piece of functionality and run it repeatedly, and Swift’s methods do much the same thing, so what’s the difference?

 Honestly, the only real difference is that methods belong to a type, such as structs, enums, and classes, whereas functions do not. That’s it – that’s the only difference. Both can accept any number of parameters, including variadic parameters, and both can return values. Heck, they are so similar that Swift still uses the func keyword to define a method.

 Of course, being associated with a specific type such as a struct means that methods gain one important super power: they can refer to the other properties and methods inside that type, meaning that you can write a describe() method for a User type that prints the user’s name, age, and city.

 There is one more advantage to methods, but it’s quite subtle: methods avoid namespace pollution. Whenever we create a function, the name of that function starts to have meaning in our code – we can write wakeUp() and have it do something. So, if you write 100 functions you end up with 100 reserved names, and if you write 1000 functions you have 1000 reserved names.

 That can get messy quickly, but by putting functionality into methods we restrict where those names are available – wakeUp() isn’t a reserved name any more unless we specifically write someUser.wakeUp(). This reduces the so-called pollution, because if most of our code is in methods then we won’t get name clashes by accident.

struct Singer {
    var signatureSong: String
    func sing() {
        print("Who wants to hear \(signatureSong)?")
    }
}


// ************** Mutating methods

/*
 If a struct has a variable property but the instance of the struct was created as a constant, that property can’t be changed – the struct is constant, so all its properties are also constant regardless of how they were created.

 The problem is that when you create the struct Swift has no idea whether you will use it with constants or variables, so by default it takes the safe approach: Swift won’t let you write methods that change properties unless you specifically request it.

 When you want to change a property inside a method, you need to mark it using the mutating keyword, like this:
*/

struct Person {
    var name: String
    
    mutating func makeAnonymous() {
        name = "Anonymous"
    }
}

// Because it changes the property, Swift will only allow that method to be called on Person instances that are variables:


var person = Person(name: "Felipe")
print(person.name)
person.makeAnonymous()
print(person.name)

// Why do we need to mark some methods as mutating?
/*
 It’s possible to modify the properties of a struct, but only if that struct is created as a variable. Of course, inside your struct there’s no way of telling whether you’ll be working with a variable struct or a constant struct, so Swift has a simple solution: any time a struct’s method tries to change any properties, you must mark it as mutating.

 You don’t need to do anything else other than mark the method as mutating, but doing that gives Swift enough information to stop that method from being used with constant struct instances.

 There are two important details you’ll find useful:

 Marking methods as mutating will stop the method from being called on constant structs, even if the method itself doesn’t actually change any properties. If you say it changes stuff, Swift believes you!
 A method that is not marked as mutating cannot call a mutating function – you must mark them both as mutating.
*/


struct Bicycle {
    var currentGear: Int
    mutating func changeGear(to newGear: Int) {
        currentGear = newGear
        print("I'm now in gear \(currentGear).")
    }
}


// ********** Properties and methods of strings

/*
 We’ve used lots of strings so far, and it turns out they are structs – they have their own methods and properties we can use to query and manipulate the string.

 First, let’s create a test string:
*/

let string = "Do or do not, there is no try."

// You can read the number of characters in a string using its count property:

print(string.count)

// They have a hasPrefix() method that returns true if the string starts with specific letters:

print(string.hasPrefix("Do"))

// You can uppercase a string by calling its uppercased() method:

print(string.uppercased())

// And you can even have Swift sort the letters of the string into an array:

print(string.sorted())

// Strings have lots more properties and methods – try typing string. to bring up Xcode’s code completion options.

// Why are strings structs in Swift?
/*
 In many other languages, strings aren’t structs – they are just a sequence of letters, and nothing more. Swift takes a different approach: strings are structs, and in fact come packed with functionality.

 Almost all of Swift’s core types are implemented as structs, including strings, integers, arrays, dictionaries, and even Booleans. This isn’t an accident: structs are simple, fast, and efficient in Swift, which means we can create and destroy them as much as we need without worrying too much about performance.

 However, strings are a particularly complicated problem to solve because language is complex. Yes, things like the English alphabet takes just 26 lowercase and 26 uppercase characters, but Swift also needs to be able to handle other scripts – Hebrew, Arabic, Cyrillic, Tamil, and many more. Heck, there are over 50,000 Chinese characters!

 Where things get really complex is how we handle emoji, because there are countless variations for skin tone and gender. Rather than storing each emoji as a unique “letter”, these often broken down into multiple special letters. For example, the emoji “two women holding hands, where the the left woman has light skin tone and the right woman has medium-dark skin tone,” Swift actually stores:

 Woman
 Light skin tone
 Joined to
 Shaking hands
 Joined to
 Woman
 Medium-dark skin tone
 So, we actually use seven “letters” to store one emoji in that instance – it’s complicated!

 As a result, Swift encapsulates all the functionality to handle strings into the string themselves. This means we can use functionality such as the count property without worrying about it miscounting emoji. The alternative would be to have hundreds of standalone functions to handle strings and their complexities, which wouldn’t be pleasant.

 Now you understand some of the complexities of strings, take another look at these properties and methods:
*/
print(string.count)
print(string.hasPrefix("Hello"))
print(string.uppercased())
print(string.sorted())

/*
 I hope you can see they do a heck of a lot of work on our behalf! Sorting a string with emoji would cause all sorts of problems if the individual characters inside the emoji were pulled apart. Fortunately, Swift’s strings are designed to take care of all this work for us, and although it causes a few road bumps here and there the overall benefit is massive.
*/


let quote = "Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so."
quote.contains("Lunch")


// Properties and methods of arrays

/*
 Arrays are also structs, which means they too have their own methods and properties we can use to query and manipulate the array.

 Here’s a simple array to get us started:
*/

var toys = ["Woody"]

// You can read the number of items in an array using its count property:

print("count array toys \(toys.count)")

// If you want to add a new item, use the append() method like this:
toys.append("Buzz")

// You can locate any item inside an array using its firstIndex() method, like this:

toys.firstIndex(of: "Buzz")

//That will return 1 because arrays count from 0.
//Just like with strings, you can have Swift sort the items of the array alphabetically:

print("toys array sorted \(toys.sorted())")

toys.remove(at: 0)

// Arrays have lots more properties and methods – try typing toys. to bring up Xcode’s code completion options.

// Why do strings behave differently from arrays in Swift?

/*
 If you think about it, strings are really just lots of individual characters that come together to form text: “Hello”, for example. But whereas Swift lets us read array values using myArray[3], we can’t do the same with strings – myString[3] is invalid.

 The reason for this goes back to emoji and other similarly complex characters, which are made up of multiple special characters back to back. Although they are individual letters, they must be treated as one cohesive unit: we can’t take just part of an emoji, because it wouldn’t make sense. For example, the US flag is made up of the characters “Regional indicator symbol letter U” and “Regional indicator symbol letter BS, which, when put together, are interpreted as the United States flag.

 Those two characters can’t be pulled apart individually – if you read the first character of the string, you wouldn’t want to get back “Regional indicator symbol letter U”, or half the US flag, or something weird. Instead, both of them need to be kept together in order for the emoji to make sense.

 What this means is that if you have a string containing four emoji, it’s possible your string contains 10 or even 20 of these special symbols. Many of them are likely meaningless to humans by themselves, and only have the correct emoji meaning when joined with the other special symbols around them.

 Now think about trying to read the fourth character of a string using something like myString[3]. If I wrote out a string on some graph paper, one letter per box, and asked you to jump to the fourth letter, you could just count along four boxes and you’d be there – you wouldn’t actually need to know how many letters were in each box. And that system scales beautifully: if our graph paper had 50 boxes per page, and I asked you to read letter 50,000, you could literally skip over hundreds of pages without even counting the boxes, because you know there’s always exactly one letter per box and 50 boxes per page.

 Now imagine I said to you that actually only some letters took up one box on the grid paper. Some took up two boxes, some three, some four, some five and some even more than that. How would you find letter 50,000 now?

 The answer is that you’d need to start at the very first letter, then move along box by box, one by one, checking every box to see whether it contained a letter by itself or was one special character that was part of a larger letter.

 Well, this little thought experiment is actually exactly how Swift works: if you ask for character 50,000 in a string, it needs to start at the very beginning and count all the way through letter by letter until it finds the one you want. It’s slow, and gets slower the further through a string you want to read.

 And so the Swift team made a decision: yes, they absolutely could make myString[49999] work, but if they did that you might think the code was easy. So, they specifically made that functionality unavailable so that folks wouldn’t write it by accident and wonder why their code was slow.

 In case you were curious, arrays don’t have the same problem, because they store everything in a box that’s exactly the same size. This is because their usage is very different from strings: we nearly always use strings in their entirety, whereas it’s more common to read individual items from an array.

 Before I’m done, I want to add one thing that might not have occurred to you: if you want to check whether a string is empty, you should write this:
*/

let myString = "Hello"

if myString.isEmpty {
    // code
}

if myString.count == 0 {
    // code
}

/*
 The first code can return true if the string has any letters, but the second has to count all the letters in the string – has to go through all the boxes in our grid paper – just to compare that final number against 0.

 If you’d like more detail on this topic, I have a blog post that will help: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/181/why-using-isempty-is-faster-than-checking-count-0
